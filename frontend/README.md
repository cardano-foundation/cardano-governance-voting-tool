# Voting Frontend

The frontend for this voting tool is an [Elm][elm] application, based on the [elm-cardano][elm-cardano] framework.
It’s a non-conventional choice with tradeoffs, but also strong benefits, both for user experience and open contributions.
If you have any question about Elm or elm-cardano, don’t hesitate to ask them in the [`#elm` channel of TxPipe discord][elm-txpipe].
Any elm enthousiast there will happily answer them.

## Getting Started (code)

To build the frontend app, you will need to install [elm][elm] and [elm-cardano][elm-cardano], as well as other tools for the Elm language.
All of these can be installed directly with npm.

```sh
# Install locally elm, elm-cardano, elm-test, ...
cd frontend/
npm install
```

Once these dev tools are installed via npm, you can build the app by calling the `elm-cardano` command.

```sh
# (DON’T DO THIS) Build the app manually
npx elm-cardano make src/Main.elm --output static/main.js
# (DO THIS) Build the app with the npm script command
npm run make
```
